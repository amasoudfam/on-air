# Pflag Package

The Pflag package is a powerful command-line flag parsing library for Go. It provides a simple and intuitive way to define, parse, and handle command-line flags in your applications.

go get -u github.com/spf13/pflag
```

go
Copy code

```go
import "github.com/spf13/pflag"
```

### Features

The Pflag package offers the following features:

* Defining flags with various data types (string, bool, int, etc.)
* Specifying flag aliases and default values
* Parsing command-line arguments and extracting flag values
* Automatic generation of help and usage information
* Support for flag grouping and subcommands
* Handling of positional arguments
* Integration with other flag packages, including the standard library's flag package

## Why we use pflag package

We use Pflag in this project instead of the built-in flag package because it seamlessly integrates with Cobra and avoids conflicts. Pflag provides enhanced functionality and flexibility for handling command-line flags. It supports features like flag grouping, subcommands, and different flag types, allowing us to define and handle complex command-line interfaces more easily. By using Pflag alongside Cobra, we can have a smooth and conflict-free experience when defining and accessing command-line flags in our application.
